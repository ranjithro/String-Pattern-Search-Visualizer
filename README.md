# 🔍 String Pattern Search Visualizer

A web-based visualizer for classic string pattern matching algorithms — **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** and **Rabin-Karp**.  
This interactive tool helps learners and developers understand how these algorithms work internally by highlighting comparisons, shifts, and matches.
